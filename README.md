# Catering-services

The mission and vision consists on the following Objectives: To provide catering and event management services, that has not been experienced in the industry at affordable rates. To become the premier choice for corporate and government events, for event planning and brandling. To incorporate event management research and development functions in the company in the first five years. To achieve consistently a return on investment superior to all others to provide the basis for the long term capital growth. To be a company admired for its values and standards to all our clients. It takes up a lot of time to manually keep track of sales and place correct orders to vendors, wasting useful labor in trivial works. So we are developing a product which will help solving problems of the clients. This system can increase the efficiency of daily business transactions performed in the catering company by computerizing the entire current system. With this new computerized system many of the existing business processes such as total calculation, orders taking are done with the aid of computer. This will save time and error-free system will be created.
